    'B=A⊤': 'For A ∈ Rm×n the matrix B ∈ Rn×m with bij =aji iscalled the transpose of A',
    'pivot': 'The leading coefficient of a row (first nonzero number from the left) is called the pivot and is always strictly to the right of the pivot of the row above it. Therefore, any equation system in row-echelon form always has a “staircase” structure',
    'Row-Echelon Form':'''All rows that contain only zeros are at the bottom of the matrix; corre- spondingly, all rows that contain at least one nonzero element are on top of rows that contain only zeros.
Looking at nonzero rows only, the first nonzero number from the left(also called the pivot or the leading coefficient) is always strictly to the right of the pivot of the row above it. ''',
    'Gaussian elimination':'an algorithm that performs elementary transformations to bring a system of linear equations into reduced row-echelon form'
